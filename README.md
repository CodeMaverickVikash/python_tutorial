# Python learning project
This project will demonstrate the learning of python concepts.

### Quick setup:
- **Install python** - Download and install python according to your OS, while install make sure you have checked the option to add Python to your system PATH.
- **Set Up a Development Environment** - Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE). Some popular options include:
    - ***Visual Studio Code (VSCode)***: A lightweight, powerful code editor.
    - ***PyCharm***: A full-featured IDE for Python development.
    - ***Jupyter Notebooks***: Great for data science and interactive coding.
- **Verify installation** - 
  - Open a terminal or command prompt.
  - Type ```python --version``` or ```python -V``` to check that Python is    installed.
  - Type ```pip --version``` to check the version of the package manager (pip) that comes with Python. 

## Python concepts

- **Variables and Data Types**:
  - ***Data type*** - Common data types include integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), lists (list), tuples (tuple), and dictionaries (dict).
  - ***Dynamic typing*** - This means that you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable when you create it. Instead, the data type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to the variable.
- **Operators**: 
  - Same as other programming languages like javascript, java etc.
- **Control Flow**:
  - ***Conditional statements*** - ```if```, ```elif```, ```else```.
  - ***Looping*** - ```for```, ```while```. Break and continue statements.
- **Functions** - ```def``` keyword.
  - Defining and calling functions
  - Parameters and return values
  - Lambda functions
- **Lists and Tuples** - 
  - Lists ```[]``` and tuples ```()``` are used to store ordered collections of items.
  - Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, while tuples are immutable.
- **Dictionaries and Sets** - 
  - Dictionaries store key-value pairs and are defined using curly braces ```{}```.
- **Classes and Objects** - 
  - Python is an object-oriented programming language.
  - Classes are used to define blueprints for objects, and objects are instances of classes.
- **File Handling**:
  - Python provides built-in functions to read from and write to files.
  - Working with different file formats (JSON, CSV)
- **Modules and Packages**:
  - Importing modules
  - Creating and using packages
- **Exception Handling**:
  - try, except, else, finally blocks
  - Handling specific exceptions
- **Functional Programming**:
  - Higher-order functions
  - Map, filter, reduce functions
- **Virtual Environments**:
  - Using virtual environments to manage dependencies
